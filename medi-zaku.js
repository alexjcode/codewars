Every day a new frog is born weight 0g and grows at a rate of 10g/day, maxing out at 100g in 10 days

	On day n, what is the total weight of the frog community?

	On day n, what is the average weight of the average frog?

How might we redesign the model to allow for new frogs to be born on a manually set schedule?
